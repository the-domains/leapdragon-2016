Begin off center.

Then, recalibrate. That is how 2016 begins.

Last year, of course, didn't end as it was meant to end. Last year was supposed to be our year. And, in a twisted way, it was---but that twisting now has to be undone.

After spending most of 2015 finishing the job of "peeling away layers," I now realize that this peeling away was wrongheaded from the start. Sometimes, the conventional wisdom---even when espoused by those that love and care for you---is entirely wrong.

There is a great deal of 'net Zen going on these days---admonitions to simplify, reduce, return to basics, find your core, and so on. The thing is, when you're peeling that onion, you have to remember that the "core" isn't what you're after.

The layers are, in fact, the substance.

Start with a person.

Remove their preferences.

Remove their activities.

Remove their hobbies.

Remove their goals.

Call it them, simplified. Them, basic. Them, pure.

But do you have it right? Is it really them? In my case, it isn't. What got peeled away was me, layer by layer, bit by bit. After years of steadfastly holding up my end of the bargain in my personal life, I lost myself and, as a result and at the same time, my ability to continue to hold up my end of the bargain.

With that done, there was no strength in either one of us to continue.

Now I have to unpeel the onion, layer by layer.

It will take time; it took me decades to arrive at the place I was at, at my peak. Before I started, in response to thoughts from others, to knock myself down, brick by brick.

But now, at least, as a soon-to-be 40-something, I have a roadmap, a diagram of the onion, a blueprint for the temporarily-demolished wall.

I can build again.

And this time, I will revel in the layers and take the core entirely for granted, as I should have done all along.

The lesson in all of this: don't let pop Zen convince you to do things that you know make no sense. And certainly don't let other people use pop Zen to analyze you and encourage you to do things that you know make no sense for you.

Even if it comes from a place of caring.

Because only you can provide fundamental self-care. Only you know what's in your layers; which ones have to stay and which ones have to go. And to try to preserve other parts of your life by slowly destroying yourself is folly.

When you remove yourself, you remove the only person that exists to actually live your life. It's a paradox, a fool's game.

And now it's over.

Happy 2016\.
